# Team Tasks - Kanban Board Application

A modern, responsive Kanban board application built with Next.js 15 and React 19. Team Tasks enables teams to efficiently manage tasks, track progress, and collaborate on projects through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop Task Management**: Seamlessly move tasks between columns with smooth animations
- **Real-time Visual Feedback**: Interactive skeleton placeholders show where tasks will be placed
- **Multiple Task States**: Organize tasks as To Do, In Progress, In Review, and Done
- **Task Assignment**: Assign team members to specific tasks
- **Custom Column Creation**: Create, rename, and delete columns to fit your workflow
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Built-in light and dark theme

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:

  - Next.js 15 with React 19
  - React Server Components
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Shadcn/ui component library
  - Atlaskit Pragmatic Drag and Drop library

- **Backend**:
  - Next.js Server Actions for data mutations
  - SQLite database (via Drizzle ORM)
  - TypeScript for type safety

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash

## How It Works

### Kanban Board Structure

The application uses a column-based layout where:

- Each column represents a stage in your workflow
- Tasks are displayed as cards within columns
- Users can drag tasks between columns to update their status

### Drag and Drop Functionality

The drag and drop system provides a smooth user experience:

1. When dragging a task, a skeleton placeholder appears showing where the task will be placed
2. The skeleton fades out quickly after dropping
3. Other cards in the column smoothly animate to their new positions
4. The task database is updated in real-time via server actions

### Database Schema

The application uses a relational database structure with:

- `columns` table to store board columns
- `tasks` table to store individual tasks with relations to columns
- Task order is maintained to preserve positioning

### Component Architecture

- `TaskBoard`: Main container component
- `TaskColumn`: Manages individual columns and drop targets
- `TaskCard`: Individual task cards with drag functionality
- `TaskCardSkeleton`: Placeholder during drag operations
- `TaskDialog`: Modal for creating and editing tasks

## Customization

You can customize the application by:

- Modifying the theme in `app/globals.css`
- Extending the database schema in `lib/db/schema.ts`
- Adding new components with `npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]`
